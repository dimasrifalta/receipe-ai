# AI Recipe Generator

## Overview
You are tasked with building an AI-powered recipe generator web application using Next.js. This app will help users input ingredients and dietary preferences to generate tailored recipes.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- Create an input field for users to add ingredients manually.
- Add checkboxes or a dropdown to select dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, keto).
- Build a page to display a list of recipe suggestions based on user input.
- Each recipe card must show the title, short description, ingredients list, and preparation steps.
- Save generated recipes into a Supabase database.
- Allow users to view their history of generated recipes.
- Allow users to view details of any past recipe.

### Pages and Routes
- `/` (Home):
  - Input for ingredients.
  - Selection for dietary preferences.
  - A "Generate Recipes" button that triggers a recipe search.
- `/results` (Results Page):
  - Display the list of suggested recipes.
- `/recipe/[id]` (Recipe Detail Page):
  - Show the full recipe including ingredients and instructions.
- `/history` (History Page):
  - Show a list of previously generated recipes from the database.

### Components to Build
- `IngredientInput`: Text input and ingredient management.
- `DietaryPreferences`: List of dietary options.
- `RecipeCard`: Small component for each recipe.
- `RecipeDetails`: Full detailed view of a single recipe.
- `HistoryList`: Component to display past recipes.

### API Routes
- `POST /api/generate-recipes`
  - Accepts ingredients and dietary preferences.
  - Saves generated recipes into Supabase.
  - Returns a list of recipe objects.
- `GET /api/history`
  - Fetch previously generated recipes from Supabase.
- `GET /api/recipe/[id]`
  - Fetch details of a specific recipe from Supabase.

### Supabase Setup
- Create a table named `recipes` with the following columns:
  - `id` (uuid, primary key, default: uuid_generate_v4())
  - `title` (text)
  - `description` (text)
  - `ingredients` (text[]) // Array of ingredients
  - `steps` (text[]) // Array of preparation steps
  - `dietary_preferences` (text[]) // Array of dietary tags (e.g., vegan, keto)
  - `created_at` (timestamp, default: now())

### Supabase Client Setup (lib/supabaseClient.ts)
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL as string;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY as string;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

### Tech Stack
- Next.js (Pages Router or App Router)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- API: Use OpenAI API (or mock with dummy data initially)
- Database: Supabase for storage and authentication

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast page load and recipe generation (target <2s).
- Responsive on mobile and desktop.
- Accessible (ARIA roles and keyboard navigation).
- Secure API access to Supabase with environment variables.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to input ingredients so I can find recipes based on what I have.
- As a user, I want to specify dietary needs so I only see appropriate recipes.
- As a user, I want easy navigation and clear recipe instructions.
- As a user, I want to see my previous recipe searches.
- As a user, I want to click and view full details of a previously generated recipe.

## Suggested Project Structure
```plaintext
/pages
  index.tsx
  results.tsx
  recipe/[id].tsx
  history.tsx
/components
  IngredientInput.tsx
  DietaryPreferences.tsx
  RecipeCard.tsx
  RecipeDetails.tsx
  HistoryList.tsx
/pages/api
  generate-recipes.ts
  history.ts
  recipe/[id].ts
/public
  (static assets if needed)
/styles
  globals.css
/lib
  supabaseClient.ts (setup Supabase client)
```

## Development Timeline
- Week 1: Setup Next.js, TailwindCSS, Supabase connection, and Home page.
- Week 2: API routes for generating and fetching recipes, build Results page.
- Week 3: Build Recipe detail and History page, polish components.
- Week 4: Testing, optimization, accessibility review, and deployment.

## Bonus Ideas (optional)
- Save favorite recipes with "like" or "favorite" button.
- Share recipes with friends.
- Voice input or photo upload for ingredients.
- User authentication (login/signup) with Supabase.

# Important Notes for GitHub Copilot
- Use functional React components.
- Keep components small and reusable.
- Use TypeScript for typesafety.
- Fetch data inside `getServerSideProps` or use API calls on client-side.
- Use Supabase client inside `/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
- Store environment variables for Supabase securely.
- Follow clean code and consistent styling with TailwindCSS.
